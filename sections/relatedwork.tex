\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:relatedwork}

TOP has been studied for a long time:

executable specifications of interactive work flow systems for the web~\cite{conf/icfp/PlasmeijerAK07}
TOP in a pure functional language~\cite{conf/ppdp/PlasmeijerLMAK12}
distributed top~\cite{conf/ifl/OortgieseGAP17}

These implementations lack a formal foundation, making it harder to reason about stuff like correctness, equivalence, valuation, etc.

tophat~\cite{conf/ppdp/SteenvoordenNK19}

This formal foundation has lead to development of formal methods in TOP:

symbolic tophat~\cite{conf/ifl/NausSK19}
top with feedback~\cite{conf/sfp/NausS20}
Equivalence of programs~\cite{conf/sfp/KlijnsmaS22}
