\section{Properties}
\label{sec:properties}

As argued in the introduction of this paper, having formal semantics for our \TOP\ language has significant advantages.
For example, it allows us to perform symbolic execution and reason about an equivalence relation over tasks.
Previous work demonstrates these advantages, but each addition to the language requires a re-evaluation.
Below, we investigate how the previously established properties of tasks are affected by the addition of task pools to \TOPHAT.
