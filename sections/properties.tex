\section{Properties}
\label{sec:properties}

As argued in the introduction of this paper, having a formal semantics for our \TOP language has significant advantages.
It allows us to perform symbolic execution and about an equivalence relation over tasks, for example.
Previous work demonstrates these advantages, but each addition to the language requires a re-evaluation.
Below, we investigate how the previously established properties of tasks are affected by the addition of task pools to \TOPHAT.
