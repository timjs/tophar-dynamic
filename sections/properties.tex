\section{Properties}

\subsection{Meta theory}

Propositions from \cite{Steenvoorden22} and \cite{Klijnsma2020} that still hold are the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Valued tasks are static
  \item Steady tasks stay steady
\end{itemize}

However, because of the dynamic nature of task pools, the following propositions need alteration:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Static tasks stay static
  \item Finished tasks stay finished
\end{itemize}

This is because task pools can always receive the initialise input ($\Init$),
so tasks containing a task pool will never get to a steady state!

We will discuss the impact on equational reasoning on tasks more thoroughly...
