\paragraph{Future work}
\label{sec:future-work}

In the future, we would like to investigate the amount of real-world tasks written in \ITASKS\ that could be rewritten by using task pools.
This way, such tasks could benefit from validation by symbolic execution without compromising expressivity.
Also, developers could use the transformation rules from \citet{conf/sfp/KlijnsmaS22} to refactor their programs.

It would be even more interesting, however, when task pools will fall short in these real-world examples.
In that case, we would like to investigate which additional power is needed in \TOPHAT\ to write these programs and reason about them.
